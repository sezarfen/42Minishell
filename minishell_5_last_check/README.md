## What is shell?
A shell is a computer program that allows you to directly control a computerâ€™s operating system (OS), via shell we can run our commands, programs, and shell scripts. You can use shell with a graphical user interface (GUI) or command-line interface (CLI).
Command-line interface in our case..

# How Does it work then?
Even though it seems very different and tough, it is actually written in C programming language, we have some functions that we can directly run programs and stuff..

# What are the steps?
Thoose are the steps I follow
